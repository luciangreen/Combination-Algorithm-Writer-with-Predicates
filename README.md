Combination Algorithm Writer with Predicates
Combination Algorithm Writer with Predicates is a SWI-Prolog algorithm that finds combinations of predicates (in algdict.pl) that satisfy the given input and output.

Getting Started
Please read the following instructions on how to install the project on your computer for writing code.

Prerequisites
None

Installing
Download this repository.
In SWI-Prolog, enter:
['caw5 copy 12'].
['listprologinterpreter1listrecursion4 copy 52'].
['listprologinterpreter3preds5 copy 52'].

Running
Example
caw00(off,function3,[],5,7,[[a,1],[b,1]],[[c,2]],[],Program),writeln(Program).
Example Output
[[function3,[a,b,c],:-,[[function1,[b,b,d]],[=,[c,d]]]],[function1,[a,b,c],:-,[[c,is,a+b]]]]

Note: Use (:-) instead of :-.

Versioning
